the same IP Address as the Central Server*

How to setup and run the Central Server:

1) Make sure that your MySQL is properly set up:
	- In a MySQL connection, using Port 3306, create a 
	Schema titled, "bomberman"
	- Import the provided tables, "users" and "gamerecords"
	into the bomberman Schema
	- In the hard code of src.centralServer.MySQLDriver,
	make sure the username and password in the: 
	"private final static String connectionString"
	are correct for your specific MySQL connection.

2) Start the src.centralServer.BMCentralServer
	- this is where the main(String args[]) for the 
	Central Server is located.

3) Type in an appropriate port number, then click the 
"Start Listening" button

4) Press the "connect" button to connect to the MySQL database

Players should now be able to connect to the Central Server with 
their indiviudal src.centralServer.BMCentralServerClient's
